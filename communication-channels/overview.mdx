## Channel Selection Guide

When choosing which channels to implement, consider:

| Channel | Response Time | Interaction Complexity | Setup Complexity | Typical Use Cases |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Website Chat | Immediate | Medium to High | Low | Support, Sales, Navigation |
| Email | Delayed | Low to Medium | Medium | Inquiries, Documentation, Forms |
| Voice | Immediate | Medium to High | High | Support, Appointments, Verification |

<Tip>
Many organizations start with the website chat widget for its ease of implementation and high visibility, then expand to other channels as their needs grow.

## Multi-Channel Strategy

For a comprehensive communication strategy, consider implementing multiple channels:

### Unified Experience

All channels can be powered by the same AI assistants, ensuring consistent:
- Information and answers
- Tone and brand voice
- Business rules and policies

### Channel Coordination

Channels can work together through:
- **Conversation Context Sharing**: Information gathered in one channel can be referenced in another
- **Cross-Channel Handoffs**: Start on webchat, continue via email
- **Unified Analytics**: See performance across all channels

### Channel-Specific Customization

While maintaining a unified experience, you can customize each channel for its unique characteristics:

- **Website Chat**: Optimize for quick exchanges and visual elements
- **Email**: Structure for detailed explanations and documentation
- **Voice**: Adapt for conversational patterns and audio-only experience
