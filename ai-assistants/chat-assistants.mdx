# Creating Chat Assistants

Chat assistants enable real-time, AI-powered conversations with your website visitors. This guide walks you through the process of creating, configuring, and deploying a chat assistant on your website.

## Before You Begin

Before creating a chat assistant, it's helpful to:

- Define the primary purpose of your assistant (support, sales, information, etc.)
- Identify common questions your assistant should answer
- Prepare any knowledge documents your assistant might need
- Consider the tone and personality your assistant should have

## Creating a New Chat Assistant

### Step 1: Initiate Creation

1. Navigate to the **Assistants** section in the sidebar
2. Click the **+ Create Assistant** button in the top-right corner
3. Select **Chat** as the assistant type
4. Click **Continue**

### Step 2: Basic Configuration

In the first section of the setup wizard, configure the basic settings:

1. **Name**: Give your assistant a descriptive name (e.g., "Support Bot", "Sales Assistant")
2. **Description**: Add a brief description of the assistant's purpose
3. **Avatar**: Upload a custom avatar image or select one from the library
4. **Language**: Choose the primary language for your assistant

<Note>
Choose a name that reflects the assistant's function. This helps users understand who they're talking to.
</Note>

### Step 3: AI Model Configuration

Configure the AI model settings to control your assistant's behavior:

1. **Instructions**: Write detailed instructions for your assistant's behavior, knowledge, and tone
   - Be specific about how it should respond
   - Define its role and limitations
   - Specify when it should escalate to a human

2. **Model**: Select the AI model to power your assistant
   - GPT-4: Most capable model for complex conversations
   - GPT-3.5: Good balance of performance and cost

3. **Temperature**: Adjust the creativity level (0.0-1.0)
   - Lower values (0.2-0.4): More consistent, conservative responses
   - Higher values (0.6-0.8): More creative, varied responses

<Accordion title="Example Instructions">
```
You are a customer support representative for Acme Inc., a company that sells office supplies.

Your name is Alex, and you should be helpful, friendly, and professional.

You can help with:
- Product information and recommendations
- Order status inquiries (but you'll need an order number)
- Return policies and procedures
- General company information

If asked about order specifics without an order number, politely ask for the order number.

If users have complex issues or want to speak with a human, offer to create a support ticket or transfer them to a human agent.

Avoid:
- Making up information about products or policies
- Promising specific delivery dates
- Handling personal data like credit card information
- Discussing competitors in detail

Always maintain a positive, helpful tone, and don't use excessive technical jargon.
```

### Step 4: Knowledge Base Connection

Connect relevant knowledge to help your assistant provide accurate information:

1. Click the **Knowledge** tab in the setup wizard
2. Select files from your Knowledge Base to associate with this assistant
3. Adjust the knowledge retrieval settings if needed:
   - **Relevance Threshold**: Set how closely content must match a query (0.0-1.0)
   - **Number of References**: How many knowledge snippets to include per response

<Note>
If you haven't uploaded knowledge files yet, you can add them later by editing the assistant.
</Note>

### Step 5: Communication Settings

Configure how your assistant handles conversations:

1. **Welcome Message**: Set the initial message users see when starting a conversation
2. **Fallback Response**: Define what the assistant says when it can't answer a question
3. **Conversation Timeout**: Set how long until an inactive conversation closes
4. **File Sharing**: Enable or disable file uploads from users

### Step 6: Human Handoff

Configure when and how your assistant transfers conversations to human agents:

1. **Handoff Triggers**: Define conditions that trigger a human handoff
   - Explicit user request
   - Multiple fallback responses
   - Specific keywords or topics
   - Sentiment detection

2. **Handoff Behavior**:
   - Set notification preferences for agents
   - Configure queue behavior
   - Define handoff messages

### Step 7: Advanced Settings

Configure additional options for your chat assistant:

1. **Persistent Context**: How much conversation history to maintain
2. **Analytics**: Enable detailed conversation analytics
3. **Message Ratings**: Allow users to rate assistant responses
4. **Custom Variables**: Define variables to track during conversations

### Step 8: Finalize Creation

1. Review all settings across the different tabs
2. Click **Create Assistant** to save your configuration
3. You'll be redirected to the assistant details page

## Testing Your Chat Assistant

Before deploying to your website, test your assistant:

1. On the assistant details page, click the **Test** tab
2. Start a conversation with your assistant
3. Try different questions and scenarios to evaluate responses
4. Check how knowledge retrieval works with various queries
5. Test human handoff functionality if configured

## Deploying on Your Website

To deploy your chat assistant on your website:

1. Navigate to the **Channels** tab on your assistant's page
2. Click **+ Add Channel** and select **Website Widget**
3. Configure the widget appearance:
   - Colors and theme
   - Position on page
   - Size and behavior
4. Configure visitor information collection if needed
5. Click **Save Configuration**
6. Copy the generated JavaScript code
7. Paste the code into your website's HTML, just before the closing `</body>` tag

<CodeGroup>
```html Website Integration Code
<!-- Flowbotic Chat Widget -->
<script>
  window.flowboticSettings = {
    widgetId: "your-widget-id",
    assistantId: "your-assistant-id",
    theme: "light",
    position: "right"
  };
  
  (function(d) {
    var s = d.createElement("script");
    s.src = "https://cdn.flowbotic.com/widget/v1/flowbotic.js";
    s.async = 1;
    d.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);
  })(document);
</script>
<!-- End Flowbotic Chat Widget -->
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices
