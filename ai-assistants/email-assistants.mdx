# Creating Email Assistants

Email assistants help automate your email communications by monitoring inboxes, understanding inquiries, and providing appropriate responses. This guide explains how to create, configure, and manage an email assistant in Flowbotic.

## Before You Begin

Before creating an email assistant, you should:

- Identify which email address(es) the assistant will monitor
- Determine the types of emails the assistant should handle
- Prepare knowledge documents relevant to common inquiries
- Consider the tone and style appropriate for your brand's emails

## Creating a New Email Assistant

### Step 1: Initiate Creation

1. Navigate to the **Assistants** section in the sidebar
2. Click the **+ Create Assistant** button
3. Select **Email** as the assistant type
4. Click **Continue**

### Step 2: Basic Configuration

In the first section of the setup wizard:

1. **Name**: Give your assistant a descriptive name (e.g., "Support Email Assistant")
2. **Description**: Add a brief description of the assistant's purpose
3. **Language**: Choose the primary language for your assistant

<Note>
The name you choose is for internal identification only; your email recipients will see the actual name configured in your email account settings.
</Note>

### Step 3: AI Model Configuration

Configure the AI model settings:

1. **Instructions**: Write detailed instructions for how your assistant should handle emails:
   - Specify the types of inquiries it should handle
   - Define its tone and writing style
   - Set guidelines for when to escalate to a human
   - Include any specific company policies or procedures

2. **Model**: Select the AI model to power your assistant
   - GPT-4: Best for complex, nuanced email communications
   - GPT-3.5: Good for straightforward inquiries

3. **Temperature**: Adjust the creativity level (0.0-1.0)
   - Lower values (0.2-0.4): More consistent, formal responses
   - Higher values (0.6-0.8): More varied, conversational responses

<Accordion title="Example Email Assistant Instructions">
```
You are an email assistant for Acme Inc., handling customer support inquiries.

Your responsibilities:
- Answer questions about products and services
- Provide order status updates when given an order number
- Handle return and exchange requests
- Forward complex technical issues to the technical team

Your response style should be:
- Professional but friendly
- Concise but thorough
- Formatted with proper email etiquette (greeting, clear paragraphs, signature)

Always include:
- A greeting with the customer's name if available
- A clear response to their inquiry
- Next steps if applicable
- A professional sign-off with your name (Alex from Acme Support)

When responding to order status inquiries:
- Verify the order number format (ACME-XXX-XXXX)
- If valid, provide the status
- If not found, ask for verification or alternative details

Forward emails to humans when:
- The inquiry involves account security
- A customer is clearly upset (multiple exclamation points, ALL CAPS, etc.)
- Legal issues are mentioned
- The query is completely outside your knowledge area

Never make up order information or product specifications if you don't have them.

## Best Practices

### Email-Specific Instructions

- Gradually expand to handle more email categories
- Regularly review escalated emails to improve instructions

### Compliance Considerations

- Ensure your assistant complies with email regulations (CAN-SPAM, GDPR, etc.)
- Include appropriate legal disclaimers in emails
- Configure proper handling of sensitive information
- Maintain records of email communications as required

## Troubleshooting
