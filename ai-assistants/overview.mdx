## Assistant Capabilities

All Flowbotic assistants share a core set of capabilities, regardless of their type:

### Natural Language Understanding

Our assistants utilize advanced language models to understand user intent, even when queries are phrased in different ways or contain typos.

### Context Awareness

Assistants maintain context throughout conversations, remembering previous messages and user information to provide more relevant responses.

### Knowledge Integration

Connect your business knowledge to assistants through our Knowledge Base feature, allowing them to reference your specific content when responding to queries.

### Customizable Behavior

### Analytics and Insights

Every interaction generates data that helps you understand performance and identify opportunities for improvement.

## Assistant Limitations

While powerful, AI assistants do have certain limitations to be aware of:

- **Knowledge Cutoff**: Assistants' built-in knowledge may not include very recent events beyond their training data
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Some issues require human judgment and may need escalation
- **Contextual Understanding**: Very complex or highly technical discussions might lead to misunderstandings
- **Ethical Boundaries**: Assistants will decline to engage with harmful, illegal, or unethical requests
