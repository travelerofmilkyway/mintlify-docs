### Step 2: Basic Configuration

In the first section of the setup wizard:

1. **Name**: Give your assistant a descriptive name (e.g., "Phone Support Assistant")
2. **Description**: Add a brief description of the assistant's purpose
3. **Language**: Choose the primary language for your assistant

<Note>
Voice assistants currently support English, Spanish, German, French, and Japanese. Additional languages are being added regularly.
</Note>

### Step 3: Voice Model Configuration

Voice assistants have specific configuration options for speech:

1. **Voice Selection**:
   - Choose from multiple voice options (gender, accent, tone)
   - Listen to voice samples
   - Adjust speaking rate and pitch if needed

2. **Speech Recognition**:
   - Select speech recognition model
   - Configure dialect settings (if applicable)
   - Set noise tolerance level

### Step 4: AI Model Configuration

Configure the AI behavior settings:

1. **Instructions**: Write detailed instructions for how your assistant should handle calls:
   - Define its role and purpose
   - Specify how to greet callers
   - Set conversation guidelines
   - Determine when to transfer to a human

2. **Model**: Select the AI model to power your assistant
   - GPT-4: Best for complex, nuanced conversations
   - GPT-3.5: Good for straightforward inquiries

3. **Temperature**: Adjust the creativity level (0.0-1.0)
   - Lower values: More consistent, predictable responses
   - Higher values: More varied, conversational responses

<Accordion title="Example Voice Assistant Instructions">
```
You are a phone support assistant for Acme Inc., answering customer calls about our products and services.

When answering calls:
1. Greet the caller politely: "Thank you for calling Acme Inc. This is Alex, your virtual assistant. How can I help you today?"
2. Listen carefully to their inquiry
3. Provide clear, concise answers
4. Speak in a natural, conversational tone
5. Use simple language and avoid jargon

You can help with:
- Product information and pricing
- Order status inquiries (if customer provides order number)
- Store locations and hours
- Basic troubleshooting for common product issues
- Scheduling appointments with sales representatives

If a caller asks about order status:
- Ask for their order number
- Only provide information if they can verify the order number
- If they don't have the order number, offer to transfer them to a representative

Transfer the call to a human representative when:
- The caller explicitly requests to speak with a human
- The inquiry is too complex for you to handle
- The caller seems frustrated or upset
- After three attempts to understand an unclear request
- For billing disputes or account-specific issues

When transferring a call:
1. Inform the caller: "I'll connect you with a representative who can better assist you. Please hold for a moment."
2. Summarize the conversation for the agent who will take the call

Always maintain a professional, helpful demeanor and speak at a moderate pace with clear pronunciation.

### Step 5: Knowledge Base Connection

Connect relevant knowledge to your voice assistant:

1. Click the **Knowledge** tab in the setup wizard
2. Select files from your Knowledge Base to associate with this assistant
3. Adjust the knowledge retrieval settings:
   - **Relevance Threshold**: Set how closely content must match (0.0-1.0)
   - **Number of References**: How many knowledge snippets to include

### Step 6: Call Handling

Configure how your assistant manages calls:

1. **Greeting Message**: Set the initial message spoken when answering calls
2. **Call Flow**:
   - Linear: Follow a specific conversation path
   - Open-ended: Allow natural conversation flow
   - IVR-style: Offer menu options to callers

3. **Call Duration**: Set maximum call length (optional)
4. **Silence Handling**: Configure how to respond to silence or unclear speech
5. **Background Music**: Add hold music if desired

Configure when and how to transfer calls to human agents:

1. **Transfer Triggers**:
   - Explicit request from caller
   - Specific keywords or phrases
   - Call complexity threshold
   - Number of misunderstandings
   - Call duration

2. **Transfer Settings**:
   - Forward number configuration
   - Agent availability rules
   - Queue behavior
   - Voicemail options

3. **Transfer Message**: Customize what the assistant says when transferring

## Best Practices for Voice Assistants

### Voice-Specific Instructions

- Emphasize natural conversational flow
- Include phonetic spellings for unusual words or brand names
- Keep sentences shorter than in written communication
- Avoid complex structures that may be difficult to follow when spoken

### Voice Selection

- Choose a voice that represents your brand personality
- Consider your audience's preferences and expectations
- Test the voice with actual content for natural flow
- Adjust speaking rate to match your typical caller expectations

### Call Flow Design

- Begin with a clear, welcoming greeting
- For first-time callers, briefly explain that they're speaking to an AI
- Design for conversation branches based on common inquiries
- Plan for interruptions and topic changes
- Create natural-sounding transitions between topics

### Error Handling

- Develop specific responses for misunderstandings
- Create recovery paths when the assistant can't help
- Configure clear transfer messaging
- Prepare for background noise and poor connections

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Poor Speech Recognition">
If your assistant has trouble understanding callers:
