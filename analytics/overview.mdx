## Key Performance Metrics

The analytics system tracks several important categories of metrics:

### Conversation Metrics

Track the volume and flow of conversations:

## Filtering and Segmentation

Refine analytics data for more focused insights:

### Time Period Selection

Analyze data from different time frames:

- Predefined ranges (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days)
- Custom date ranges
- Comparative periods (This Month vs. Last Month)
- Year-over-year comparison

<img src="/images/time-period-selection.png" alt="Time Period Selection" />
*[Screenshot placeholder: Date range selector interface]*

### Data Segmentation

Break down metrics by different dimensions:

- By assistant
- By channel
- By user attributes (location, device type, etc.)
- By conversation topic
- By custom tags

### Advanced Filtering

Create complex filters to focus on specific data:

- Conversation duration
- User satisfaction scores
- Escalation status
- Knowledge categories used
- Custom attributes

## Data Visualization

Flowbotic presents analytics using various visualization types:

- **Line Charts**: Track metrics over time
- **Bar Charts**: Compare values across categories

## API Access

Access analytics data programmatically through the Flowbotic API:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js SDK
const { FlowboticClient } = require('flowbotic-sdk');

// Initialize client
const client = new FlowboticClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

// Get analytics data
async function getConversationAnalytics() {
  try {
    const analytics = await client.analytics.getConversations({
      startDate: '2025-01-01',
      endDate: '2025-01-31',
      assistantId: 'asst_12345', // optional
      channel: 'webchat', // optional
      metrics: ['volume', 'resolution_rate', 'satisfaction']
    });
    
    console.log('Analytics data:', analytics);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch analytics:', error);
  }
}

getConversationAnalytics();
```

```python Python SDK
from flowbotic import FlowboticClient
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize client
client = FlowboticClient(api_key='your-api-key')

# Calculate date range
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)

# Get analytics data
def get_assistant_analytics():
    try:
        analytics = client.analytics.get_assistants(
            start_date=start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            end_date=end_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            assistant_id='asst_12345',  # optional
            metrics=['accuracy', 'usage', 'response_time']
        )
        
        print(f'Assistant analytics: {analytics}')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Error fetching analytics: {str(e)}')

get_assistant_analytics()
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
For detailed API documentation, see the [Analytics API Reference](/api-reference/analytics).

## Privacy and Data Handling

Analytics data is processed with privacy in mind:

- **Data Anonymization**: User identifiers are anonymized
